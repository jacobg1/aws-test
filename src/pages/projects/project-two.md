An internet radio station that plays live concert recordings for a given band and year. 

&nbsp;

Once users create their station CrunchFM makes a call to <a href="https://archive.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">archive.org's</a> API and plays random live recordings based on the user's input. Users can change their station at any time to create a unique listening experience. 

&nbsp;

As a user's station plays, CrunchFM creates a dynamic playlist of all the songs that have been listened to in that session. Users can then replay songs with the click of a button.
